# DhcpSharp
DhcpShar is a minimal DHCPv4 server based on DhcpDotNet and Pcap.NET. The server supports a simple configuration of the gateway and the address pool. The programme only supports the normal DHCPv4 handshake used for assigning IPv4 addresses. Additional functions such as the renewal of a lease are not implemented.

## See how its done
Inside the Wireshark folder is an IPv4 and IPv6 .pcap-example of what a Dhcp process can look like. For simplicity, DhcpSharp was reconstructed on the basis of the IPv4-example. The library "DhcpDotNet" is used to create the DHCP packets. In addition, the library "Pcap.NET" is used to encapsulate the DHCP packets and transmit them via the network interface.

## Coming soon
IÂ´m planning to implement the DHCP lease time mechanism in the near future, allowing clients to be reassigned an IP address after the lease time has expired. I also want to use DhcpSharp with the SharpPcap library in the future to improve performance, understandability and consistency.
